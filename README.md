# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).

## Overview

I build out this advice generator app using the Advice Slip API.

Users will be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
- For non-touch devices it will show glow on dice when hover, but for touch devices dice will keep blinking after first click
